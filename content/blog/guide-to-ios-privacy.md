{{< linebreak >}}

### Choosing the Right Device: Device Selection and Biometric Security
Select devices with features that meet your security needs. Understand the legal and security implications of biometric features like Touch ID and Face ID. Consider upgrading to a device with an A12 CPU or higher for improved security features and faster updates.
{{< linebreak >}}

### Purchasing iOS Devices Anonymously
For anonymity, purchase iOS devices with cash at physical stores and avoid any setup or registration offered in-store.
{{< linebreak >}}

### Initial Setup and Apple ID: Best Practices
Start with a new or factory reset device. Set up your Apple ID away from personal networks and use non-personal information for the account. During the initial setup, disable all connectivity options like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular data.
{{< linebreak >}}

### Passcodes and Encryption
- Strong Passcode: Opt for at least a 6-digit passcode, or better yet, an alphanumeric one for higher security.
- Biometric Security: Use Face ID or Touch ID with an understanding of the legal and privacy implications.
- Advanced Options: Turn off 'Simple Passcode' for more complex passcode options.
- Data Protection: Always enable data protection and keychain protection in your settings.
{{< linebreak >}}

### Enable Find My
Enable Find My under Settings → [Your Name] → Find My to locate, lock, or erase your device remotely if it's lost or stolen.
{{< linebreak >}}

### Enable Automatic Updates
Turn on automatic updates under Settings → General → Software Update → Automatic Updates to ensure your device always has the latest security patches.
{{< linebreak >}}

### Two-Factor Authentication
Two-factor authentication adds a critical layer of security. It combines something you know (your password) and something you have (your device). Activate it under Settings → [Your name] → Password & Security → Two-factor authentication.
{{< linebreak >}}

### Optimizing Tracking and Location Services
Privacy is key. Regularly check Settings → Privacy & Security → Tracking and toggle off 'Allow Apps to Request to Track'. Manage app permissions for location access under Settings → Location Services.
{{< linebreak >}}

### Advanced Location Services and Tracking: Disabling for Privacy
Post-setup, regularly verify location and tracking settings, especially after updates. Consider disabling non-essential location services.
{{< linebreak >}}

### Biometric ID Considerations and Legal Implications
Biometrics like Touch ID and Face ID are convenient but have legal implications. In some areas, using a passcode offers more legal protection. Consider scenarios where biometrics might be less secure than a passcode.
{{< linebreak >}}

### Enhancing Lock Screen Security
Your lock screen can be a vulnerability. Limit accessible features from Settings → Touch ID/Face ID & Passcode. This helps protect personal information even when your phone is locked.
{{< linebreak >}}

### Disable Control Center when locked
Disable access to Control Center when your device is locked under Settings → Touch ID/Face ID & Passcode to prevent unauthorized changes to settings.
{{< linebreak >}}

### Enable Stolen Device Protection
Stolen Device Protection adds a layer of security when your iPhone is away from familiar locations, such as home or work, and helps protect your accounts and personal information in case your iPhone is ever stolen.
{{< linebreak >}}
To turn on Stolen Device Protection, you must use two-factor authentication for your Apple ID and set up or enable the following on your iPhone: a device passcode; Face ID or Touch ID; and Significant Locations* (Location Services). You also need to have Find My turned on, and you can't turn it off while Stolen Device Protection is enabled.
{{< linebreak >}}
When Stolen Device Protection is enabled, some features and actions have additional security requirements when your iPhone is away from familiar locations:
{{< linebreak >}}
- Face ID or Touch ID biometric authentication: Some actions such as accessing stored passwords and credit cards require a single biometric authentication with Face ID or Touch ID — with no passcode alternative or fallback — so that only you can access these features.
- Security Delay: Some security actions such as changing your Apple ID password also require you to wait an hour and then perform a second Face ID or Touch ID authentication.
You can turn on Stolen Device Protection in Settings:
{{< linebreak >}}
Go to Settings, then tap Face ID & Passcode.
Enter your device passcode.
Tap Stolen Device Protection, then turn Stolen Device Protection on or off.
If you'd like your iPhone to enforce the additional Stolen Device Protection security measures regardless of its location, choose "Always" under Require Security Delay. By default, the additional security measures are required only when your iPhone is away from familiar locations.
{{< linebreak >}}

*Significant Locations is an option within Location Services: Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services > System Services > Significant Locations.
{{< linebreak >}}

### Managing App Permissions
Review app permissions regularly in your device settings, paying special attention to access to the microphone, camera, and location services.
{{< linebreak >}}

### Disabling Tracking and Ad Tracking
To limit ad tracking, navigate to Settings → Privacy & Security → Apple Advertising and disable 'Personalized Ads'.
{{< linebreak >}}

### Using VPN and Firewall for Enhanced Security
Protect against Wi-Fi hacking and mask your IP address with a reliable VPN. This is crucial for maintaining privacy on public networks.
